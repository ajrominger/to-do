## pull previous commit from git
## find changes
    ## if changes are change to header name, do nothing
    ## if changes are addition, do nothing
    ## if changes are deleted item, add back deleted item, but format as crossed off
        ## check that deleted items aren't actually just re-arrangement
        ## check that deleted items aren't minor edits
        ## might be easiest to have a commit function for edits vs. accomplishments
## run pandoc to format new document
## commit it back to git
