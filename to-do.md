# code
- get random number functions faster in *pika*, means making q fun in C++
- get *pika* working with *meteR*---to do so requires uploading pika to CRAN, then making meteR depend on it
- make *meteR* spatial stuff use spatial packages
- fix axis function in *socorro* to:
    - take different tranform funs
    - not over-populate axis when limits are huge (e.g. 4 ords of mag)
    - take a vector more than 1 long for the `side` argument (e.g. allowing simultaneous axis addition)

- figure out when z-val is informative (i.e. what sample size)
- test z-val to make sure the analytical version is really right 
    - see if *pika* logLikZ works when 'by hand' z from sadScaling does not
- test out different metrics like ks and mse (again!)
- figure out sample size to reject given SAD model when we don't know the true model (i.e. can't use deltaAIC of true model v. alternative model)
